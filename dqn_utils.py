        adapted for the purposes of running image segmentation via RL

        The sepecific memory optimizations use here are:
            - only store each frame once rather than k time
              even if every observation normally consists of k last frames
            - store frames as np.uint8 (actually it is most time-performance

              time)
            - store frame_t and frame_(t+1) in the same buffer.

        For the typical use case in Atari Deep RL buffer with 1M frames the total
        memory footprint of this buffer is 10^6 * 84 * 84 bytes ~= 7 gigabytes

        of the episode, when there is less frames than `frame_history_len`,
        is acceptable.
